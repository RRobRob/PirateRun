A interactive game for visually impaired children created for the Master's course "Sound and Music Technology". Please consider that the game is a testing version for the conducted experiment.

Therefore, some usability issues or not available functions are included in the current game. The reason for this is that only the researchers interacted with the menu. Those issues did not occur for the player/participant.
